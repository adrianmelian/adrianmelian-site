This is a personal project I have been working on in my free time.
It's a VR project built in Unreal Engine.
I built everything from scratch, from the concept art, modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, gameplay engineering, and a full pipeline to support the project.

This is a small demo of Krazy Kaiju! I even made the music.

This is a demo of the UFO A.I. It finds farm animals and abducts them. Shooting them will disrupt their abduction and put them into aggression mode.
