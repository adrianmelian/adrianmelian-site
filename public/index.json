Such as control shapes and colors.\rRig Templates\rTemplates are json data files which include all the data to recreate a rig made with this system. It will recreate all the joints exactly, in the same hierarchy and orientations and attach the modules needed to build the animation rig.\rAimer Controls\rAimers are used to orient joints in an intuitive and visual way.\rControl Offsets\rThis video shows how you can easily offset a controls orientation from it\u0026#39;s joint.\rBuilding a Weapon\rIn this video we will explore the various rig component modules that are used to build a weapon.\rBuilding a Character\rThis video will show the various modules used to build a bipedal character rig.
